> This is a common quiz-like task that is used at interviews for weeding out totally incompetent programmers.

Create a function that given a number, prints out different things for all numbers from 0 up tp the given number. If the number is divisible by 3 then print `fizz` and if it's divisible by 5 print `buzz`. If it's divisible by both then print `fizzbuzz`. In any other case simply print the number.

Example:

    > myfunction(5)
    0
    1
    2

    4
    buzz
    fizz
    7
