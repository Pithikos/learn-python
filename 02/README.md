Instructions
------------

Building on top of 01, we want to take this a step further and make the interface
of our fizzbuzz function via a webpage.

For this we use Flask which is a small web framework.

There are two main things expected from you:

    1. Get input the number to our function via a field in our webpage.
    2. Return the output as a new webpage.


Things to think about
---------------------

* GET vs POST
* Keeping things clean (pip, virtualenv, requirements.txt)
